## About Hypha

Like hypha and mycelium, the different products that make up a 'stack' or a list of SKUs are a part of something larger. Hypha is a robust solution designed to help you track test results across a network of interconnected products and repositories. This platform provides users with the tools to create and manage products, establish integrations, and report tests.
